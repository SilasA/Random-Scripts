# Random-Scripts
Random scripts I write to do random stuff

### defintegral.py
A simple, quickly written script for quickly finding an estimate for the area under a function.
It finds the estimate using left, middle, and right rectangle endpoints, but can be modified to do anything in between.

### real_ec.py
A script that fetches current, voting-eligible populations from each state and calculates electoral delegate counts representative of each states populations.
It also includes a side-by-side comparison of the current electoral delegate count.
